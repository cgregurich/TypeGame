CURRENT:
BUG: weird spacing and shit or missing words or something. What is causing
this?? Maybe something to do with appended new line with text file editor?
- add logs feature
- save each run (all data??)
- be able to view log
- afk checker?
- last 24 average, last 7 days average, last 30 day average?




RANDOM WORDS vs BLOCKS OF TEXT
aka 10fastfingers vs typeracer
in randomwords, when space is pressed in an empty entry, it's reset. when space is pressed after some letters, the typed word is registered; if it's wrong, it stays wrong. If it's right, then great. Either way a space after letters moves to the next word

in blocksoftext, when space is pressed in an empty entry, nothing happens; no space is inserted. when space is entered after some text, if the space is the correct key, then we keep moving on. If not, then you have to go back to the last correct letter and continue on from there.

I say we implement randomwords aka 10fastfingers first, then do blocksoftext aka typeracer after.

So current implementation mechanics: 
Space entered in empty entry -> clear entry
Space entered at end of correct word -> move on; clear entry, go to next word
Space entered at end of incorrect word -> move on; clear entry, go to next word
Correct char entered -> counts as correct, green text, w/e
Incorrect char entered -> counts as incorrect, red text, w/e


BUG - when typing word correctly and hitting space, sometimes word flickers from green to red before it disappears

- Make sure it's case sensitive

figure out how to properly see if typed word is correct so far i.e. instead of checking if typed_word is in goal_word, check if typed_word so far is part of goal_word, starting at index 0 of goal_word

- display more than one word

- add settings to game

- typing speed calculation

- save results i.e. save player's scores, high scores, averages

- allow adding own words; modifying word choice

- change game mode i.e. random words vs sentences (somehow automate grabbing chunks of text from online; goodreads quotes?)

- make ctrl + backspace work
